## Online Identity

**Assignment I:** Google the person next to you and see what information you can find online about that person. Then introduce that person to the group based on the information you find.

## Social Media

We share a large part of our lives on social media. Be careful about the information you share online.

**Assignment II:** Have a look at what you shared on social media and do a check-up, anything you want to delete?

**Assignment III:** Download your data from a social media and have a look at it. What things stand out?

**Assignment IV:** Have a look at the [Google MyActivity page][activity] and the [Google Maps Timeline][timeline]. Feel weird yet?

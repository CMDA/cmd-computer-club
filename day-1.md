Privacy and personal data have become a selling point for companies instead of *privacy by default*. Think about the *digital breadcrumbs* you leave behind when you browse the web.

## Online Identity

>**Assignment I:**
>
> Google the person next to you and see what information you can find online about that person. Then introduce that person to the group based on the information you find.

## Social Media

We share a large part of our lives on social media. Be careful about the information you share online.

> **Assignment II:**
>
> Have a look at what you shared on social media and do a check-up, anything you want to delete?

> **Assignment III:**
>
> Download your data from a social media and have a look at it. What things stand out?

> **Assignment IV:**
>
> Have a look at the [Google MyActivity page][activity] and the [Google Maps Timeline][timeline]. Feel weird yet?

## Communication

### Chat
> **Assignment V:**
>
> Find an alternative to WhatsApp!

### Mail

> **Assignment VI:**
>
> Find an alternative to Gmail!

## Browsers

### Extensions
Surfing the web can be bloated with ads. Browser extensions will block these sites.

> **Assignment VII:**
>
> Install a couple of *privacy-focused* extensions such as uBlock origin or Privacy Badger.

## Virtual Private Network

As soon as you connect to a public WiFi network, a VPN builds a digital tunnel for your data traffic. Others won’t be able to see what you do on the internet

> **Assignment VIII:**
>
> Try drawing on a paper how you think a VPN works!

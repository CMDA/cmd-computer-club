Privacy and personal data have become a selling point for companies instead of *privacy by default*. Think about the *digital breadcrumbs* you leave behind when you browse the web.

## 1. Online Identity

>**Assignment 1.0**
>
> Search the person on the web and see what information you can find about that person. Then introduce that person to the group based on the information you find.

## 2. Social Media

We share a large part of our lives on social media. Be careful about the information you share online. Often people share personal information such as tickets, drivers license and passports. **It’s mostly a matter of realising what the risks are to you.** The Internet never forgets.

> **Assignment 2.0**
>
> Have a look at what you shared on social media (instagram, twitter, old tumblr accounts?) and do a check-up, anything you want to delete? Did you ever share information you wish you kept private?

> **Assignment 2.1**
>
> Download your data from a social media channel and have a look at it. You can use [My Data Done Right][mydata] a project by [Bits of Freedom][freedom] to access, remove, correct, or move your data. 

> **Assignment 2.2**
>
> Most services store all your activity to make those services 'more useful for you'. Have a look at the [Google MyActivity page][activity] and the [Google Maps Timeline][timeline]. Feel weird yet? You can choose to [automatically delete your][delete] activity (such as youTube history).

## 3. Communication

We connect with people. We send lots of digital messages, let's do that safe, secure and private. You'll usually want  service that has [end-to-end encryption][end].

> **Assignment 3.0**
>
> Have a look at some of the chat services you are using. Do they use end-to-end encryption? WhatsApp is owned by Facebook; a company that makes its money by collecting as much information about its users as it can. Can you find an alternative to WhatsApp?

## 4. Browsers
While surfing the web you are bombarded with ads. Those are annoying but websites also install cookies and use trackers to follow you around websites. Browser extensions will block these sites.

> **Assignment 4.0:**
>
> Install a couple of *privacy-focused* extensions and add-ons. [Privacytools.io][tools] and the [Bits of Freedom Toolbox][tool] are good lists of extensions to start with.

> **Assignment 4.1:**
>
> Try out a different browser then you are currently using. What are the differences? You are probably using chrome or safari. Have you ever tried [Brave][br], [Opera][op] or [Vivaldi][viv]?

> **Assignment 4.2:**
> 
> Make a diagram on how you think the internet works. Show after you enter a `url` in the address bar of a web browser, what happens? 

## 5. Virtual Private Networks

As soon as you connect to a public WiFi network, a VPN builds a digital tunnel for your data traffic. Others won’t be able to see what you do on the internet

**Read about VPNs on [watchyourhack.com](vpn)**

> **Assignment 5.0**
>
> Get a piece of paper and in duo's try to explain a VPN in your own words. Research online, have a look at different services and write it down.

> **Assignment 5.1**  
> 
> Look at the diagram of *4.1* where does the VPN fit in?

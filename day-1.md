## Online Identity

>**Assignment I:**

>
> Have a look at what you shared on social media and do a check-up, anything you want to delete?

> **Assignment III:**
>
> Download your data from a social media and have a look at it. What things stand out?

> **Assignment IV:**
>
> Have a look at the [Google MyActivity page][activity] and the [Google Maps Timeline][timeline]. Feel weird yet?

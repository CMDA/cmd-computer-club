<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I guess it’s time to get back to work <a href="https://t.co/pUFaFio6Ur">pic.twitter.com/pUFaFio6Ur</a></p>&mdash; Cassidy Williams (@cassidoo) <a href="https://twitter.com/cassidoo/status/1179110386445905920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

A few golden rules:

* Automate everything you possible can.
* Search instead of navigate.
* Find keyboard shortcuts for commonly used actions.

## 1. System Settings

It's beneficial to be proficient with your tools: it’ll save you a lot of time and make you feel more comfortable behind your MacBook. It's the same with driving, at some point you can control the car almost *automatically* so you can *focus on the traffic*.

> **Assignment 1.0**
>
> Open your system preferences and play around with some. Anything you want to customize? You might want to tweak your dock or have a look at some accessibility settings.

> **Assignment 1.1**
>
> You spend quite some time in finder. You can customize how items get viewed. Play around with the settings.

## 2. Hidden OS settings

> **Assignment 2.0**
>
> There are a lot of 'hidden' and 'secret' settings that can only be enabled trough the command line. [Snazzylabs ][snazzy] has some video's about them.

> **Assignment 2.1**
>
> There are a lot of 'hidden' and 'secret' settings that can only be enabled trough the command line.

> 🚨 **Nerd Alert!**
>
> **Optional assignment**:
> *Have a look at what `.dotfiles` are and try to create your own `.macos` executable to set-up your computer.*

#### Keyboard remapping
* Caps locks to ctrl
* Key repeat
* Trackpad gestures
* MacOS touchbar
* Keyboard shortcuts in applications

> **Assignment 2.2**
>
> Have a look at your keyboard and trackpad settings. Any gestures you did not know of?

> **Assignment 2.3**
>
> Have a look at some common macOS shortcuts, write down some your frequently use.

## 3. Utilities

You can extend the capabilities of your OS by installing applications, menu bar items and utilities. 

> **Assignment 3.0**
>
> You probably don't want to manually drag windows. You can use a [window manager][window] for that. Find one, install it and try it out!

> **Assignment 3.1**
>
> Have a look at [MacMenuBar][menu]. Any handy utilities our applications you want to install? You can look at [Powertoys][power] for Windows.

## 📝 IMO (1:00h)

A few golden rules:

* Automate everything you possible can.
* Search instead of navigate.
* Find keyboard shortcuts for commonly used actions.

## 1. System Settings

It's beneficial to be proficient with your tools: it’ll save you a lot of time and make you feel more comfortable behind your MacBook. It's the same with driving, at some point you can control the car almost *automatically* so you can *focus on the traffic*.

> **Assignment 1.0**
>
> Open your system preferences and play around with some. Anything you want to customize? You might want to tweak your dock or have a look at some accessibility settings.

> **Assignment 1.1**
>
> You spend quite some time in finder. You can customize how items get viewed. Play around with the settings.

> **Assignment 1.2**
>
> You can also customize your dock (taskbar). Change icons, change the size, [auto-hide][hide] it, put [whitespace between items][items]. 

> **Assignment 1.3**
>
> Have a look at [automator][automator]. Any repetitive tasks you can automate? You might also want to take a look at [Siri shortcuts][siri].

> **Assignment 1.4**
>
> You can also try out [IFTTT][ifttt] to automate between multiple devices (phone and macbook). 


## 2. Hidden OS settings

> **Assignment 2.0**
>
> There are a lot of 'hidden' and 'secret' settings that can only be enabled trough the command line. [Snazzylabs ][snazzy] has some video's about them. Have a look at some of his video's and see if you can enable any additional settings.

> 🚨 **Nerd Alert!**
>
> **Optional assignment**:
> *Have a look at what `.dotfiles` are and try to create your own `.macos` executable to set-up your computer.*

#### Keyboard remapping
* Caps locks to ctrl
* Key repeat
* Trackpad gestures
* MacOS touchbar
* Keyboard shortcuts in applications

> **Assignment 2.2**
>
> Have a look at your keyboard and trackpad settings. What can you customize? Can you remap keys on your keyboard?

> **Assignment 2.3**
>
> Have a look at some common OS shortcuts, write down some your frequently use. Any new ones you did now of?

## 3. Utilities

You can extend the capabilities of your OS by installing applications, menu bar items and utilities. 

> **Assignment 3.0**
>
> You probably don't want to manually drag windows. You can use a [window manager][window] for that. Find one, install it and try it out!

> **Assignment 3.1**
>
> Have a look at [MacMenuBar][menu]. Any handy utilities our applications you want to install? You can look at [Powertoys][power] for Windows.

* Single Board Computer (Raspberry Pi)
* Server (computation)
* Smartphones & Tablets

> **Assignment I:**
>
> [Here's a picture][desktop] of a Desktop computer, and [here's a picture][macbook] of a MacBook. Look at it and try to annotate all the different parts that make up the computer.

## Software

> **Optional assignment**:
> *Install virtualbox (open-source) and try another operating system such as [Manjaro][manjaro], [Elementary][elementary] or any other [privacy-focused OS.][os] You can also play around with [Boot Camp][bootcamp] to run Windows on your MacBook.*

## Backups
Any data you own that you havenâ€™t backed up is data that could be gone at any moment, forever. When your laptop gets stolen, is everything lost?
